    activity across income groups. For Clinton's proposal, provisions
    included are: (1) Surtax of 4% on AGI over 5mm; (2) Fair share tax
    (Buffett Rule) (30% minimum tax); (3) Limit the deductions to 28%. For
    Trump's propsal, provisions included are: (1) Three Tax Brackets (12%, 25%,
    33%); (2) Change thresholds for CG/AMT; (3) Repeal AMT and Obamacare tax on
    investment income; (4) Change the standard deduction threshold; (5) Repeal
    personal exemptions; (6) Repeal HH status (all HH's threshold equals
    single's); (7) Cap itemized deductions. The interaction will allow
    users to select from different filing status, namely single, joint, or
